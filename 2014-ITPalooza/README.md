# Discovering the Lean Kanban Method
## A presentation for the ITPalooza conference 

### Summary

Your company has heard that agile development is the way to go. You may have heard of Scrum and XP, but there is a relatively newer form of agile development called “Kanban” that has been gaining market share in the last few years. The recent popularity stems from its ease of implementation, use of visual cues, ability to handle a wide variety of software development and operations teams. Kanban also has an unflinching aspiration for continuous improvement to provide better business value. Many groups have turned to Kanban when popular methods did not generate the desired improvements. So, what exactly is Kanban? How is it related to other agile methods? When would you use Kanban versus other methods? If Kanban is right for my group how do I get started? These are the questions we will explore in this session.
